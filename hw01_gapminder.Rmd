##Get the Gapminder data
Work with some of the data from the [Gapminder project](http://www.gapminder.org). Since the package is already installed, we just need to load it, also load the package that are useful for analyzing the data.

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


Have a look at the data:
```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)
dim(gapminder)
```

Explore the variable *"pop"*
```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
min(gapminder$pop)
max(gapminder$pop)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(y = pop)) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = factor(1))) +  facet_wrap(~continent, scales = "free")
```

Because gapminder has too much info, in my work, I just extract the data that belong to the continent of Asia, and variables *"country"*, *"year"*, and *"pop"*.
```{r}
gDat <- gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Asia", c("country", "year", "pop")]
str(gDat)
```

Plot annual population for different countries in Asia 
```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=5}
ggplot(gDat, aes(x = year, y = pop)) + geom_point(aes(color = country)) 
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
