## My Process During the Assignment

- Include a description of how you got the changes into README.md on GitHub.
  + Did you edit in the browser at github.com?
    * Yes! Locate to the file in github and click the edit button on the up-right corner.
  + Did you pull, edit locally, save, commit, push to github.com?
    * Yes! I am using terminal to do this. (command like: git pull, git status, git add, git commit -m"", git push,..) Also, the button of pull/push built within R-studio is easy to use.
  + How did it all work for the R Markdown document? 
    * I am familiar with terminal commands, so push/pull part seems easy to me. 
    When I was knitting my files in local ends, everything seems fine, but after uploading to github, some displays changes. I found that the markdown file is sensitive to whether or not there is a blank line in between two chuncks, two spaces/one space. 
    More importantly, when I uploaded only the rmd and md files, the figure could not display properly. It seems all my generated figures are missing. I looked for it in the website, and find this [one](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Discussion/issues/11) is particularly useful for my situation. I follow the instructions and upload the generated figures and it finally works.
