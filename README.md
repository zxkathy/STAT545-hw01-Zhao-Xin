## My Process During the Assignment

- Include a description of how you got the changes into README.md on GitHub.
  + Did you edit in the browser at github.com?
    * Yes! Locate to the file in github and click the edit button on the up-right corner.
  + Did you pull, edit locally, save, commit, push to github.com?
    * Yes! I am using terminal to do this. (command like: git pull, git status, git add, git commit -m"", git push,..) Also, the button of pull/push built within R-studio is easy to use.
  + How did it all work for the R Markdown document? 
    * 
  + Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.
